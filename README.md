# Advent of Code 2019

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

[Read up about the event over at the official Advent of Code website.](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

This repository contains the solutions I've created for each day's challenges using Python.

Consider joining in on the fun by [viewing the daily challenges yourself](https://adventofcode.com/2019) and consider dropping by the [Python Discord community](https://discord.gg/python) for discussions about the event.
